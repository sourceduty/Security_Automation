[Security Automation](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-o2BODDHHU-security-automation) was developed to assist users with automating and optimizing cybersecurity processes. This includes a strong focus on Internet of Things (IoT) devices, which are often more vulnerable to security threats due to their connectivity and limited security measures. Security Automation aims to provide expert guidance on setting up automated security protocols, ensuring that these devices remain protected against common cyber threats.

In addition to IoT security, Security Automation is well-versed in general cybersecurity best practices. It offers advice on integrating various security tools, such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and antivirus software, into a cohesive and automated security strategy. By doing so, users can maintain a robust security posture with minimal manual intervention, freeing up time and resources for other critical tasks.

Moreover, Security Automation emphasizes the importance of consulting cybersecurity professionals for more sensitive and critical issues, such as actual security breaches or personal data vulnerabilities. While it provides a wealth of information on secure practices and automation techniques, it maintains a clear boundary by not delving into specific advice that could be risky if not tailored to the user's particular situation. This approach ensures that users are equipped with the knowledge to implement secure solutions while recognizing when expert help is necessary.
